Red & Black "Crimson" Photo Gallery
This project is a stylish, fully responsive, single-page photo gallery with a dark theme and vibrant red accents. It allows users to browse a grid of images and view a larger version in a modal (lightbox) window upon clicking a thumbnail.

#Features
Stunning Dark Theme: A sophisticated, near-black background with bold, red gradient text and accents for a high-contrast aesthetic.

Responsive Image Grid: The gallery layout automatically adjusts to look great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop screens, using a flexible grid system.

Interactive Lightbox: Click on any image thumbnail to open a full-size version in a smooth, fading modal window. The lightbox can be closed by clicking the 'X' button, pressing the Escape key, or clicking on the background overlay.

Dynamic Hover Effects: Images feature a subtle "red glow" effect when hovered over, providing visual feedback and enhancing the user experience.

Custom Fonts: Utilizes "Playfair Display" for the elegant header and "Inter" for clean, readable body text.

Single-File Solution: All the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are contained within a single index.html file, making it incredibly easy to use and deploy.

#Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and content of the web page.

Tailwind CSS: For a utility-first approach to styling and creating a responsive layout.

Custom CSS: For unique styling elements like the text gradient and hover effects.

Vanilla JavaScript: To handle all the interactive elements, including the lightbox functionality.

Google Fonts: For importing the custom typefaces used in the design.

#How to Use
Download: Save the index.html file to your local machine.

Open: Open the index.html file directly in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).

Customize: To use your own images, simply edit the <img> tags inside the <main> section:

Update the src attribute with the path to your thumbnail image.

Update the data-large-src attribute with the path to the high-resolution image you want to display in the lightbox.
